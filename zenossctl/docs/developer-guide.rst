Developer Guide
---------------

You'd like to contribute features or fixes to zenossctl? Great! We'd love to have them.

It is highly recommended that you have a github.com account if you would like to contribute code. Create an account, log in, and then go to github.com/libertas-ict/zenossctl to "fork" the project.

Create a new branch named after the feature you are working on. Do the work on your local machine, please make sure your work passes the coding standards by using `make qa`. Only then push to your personal Github branch (e.g. github.com/yourname/zenossctl).

Then use the "submit pull request" feature of Github to request that the official repo pull in your changes. Be sure to include a full description of what your change does in the comments, including what you have tested (and other things that you may have not been able to test well and need help with).

If the patch needs more work, we'll let you know in the comments.

Do not mix work on different features in different pull requests/branches if at all possible as this makes it difficult to take only some of the work at one time, and to quickly slurp in some changes why others get hammered out.

Once we merge in your pull request, you can remove the branch from your repo if you like. The AUTHORS file is created automatically when we release.
